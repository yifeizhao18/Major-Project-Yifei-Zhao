# Major Project Proposal
## Description 
For the major project, I will be creating an escape room style game. This game will set at a hospital. There will be characters that the user has to fight with. The goal of this game for the user is to escape the hospital. There will be puzzles the user has to solve in order to unlock the doors. They will be able to collect objects during their visit to help them fight the enemies. This will be done individually. The target user will be people who loves escape rooms and text vased adventure games. 
## Need To Have List:
- enemies that the user will be fighting with
- different levels of enemies
- description of the rooms in the hospital to make it more real and draw the user's interest in
- create objects that the user will be able to collect to help them in the game
- create objects that help the user to fight the enemies (ex. sword, knife...)
- create objects that help the user to survive the game (ex. food and drinks...)
- puzzles that the user will have to solve in order to unlock doors
- create a pathway for the user to go through (There will be no maps as the user will not get to choose where they go next. The user will go to the next room once they unlocked the door.)
- what objects can be found will be randomized
- what enemies the user will face will also be randomized
## Nice To Have List:
- sound effects
- have lots of different types of enemies and lots of different way to kill enemies.
- different background music for different rooms
- decent descriptions for the user to follow
- different locations for the user to choose from and not just limited to the hospital setting
- have a scoring system to appear on the screen and give updates to the user and their current status
- have different endings
- have images
- surprising events to happen randomly throughout the game
